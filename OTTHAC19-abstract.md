# Ottawa Hockey Analytics at Carleton 2019 conference abstract (OTTHAC19) 

In this project, we propose a novel way of automatically rocognizes hockey rings key components. To do so, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) that aims to learn the semantic of a hockey broadcast image. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task whre the model learns the general representation of an image by attributing a label to each and every pixels.  The dataset is composed of images extracted from NHL recap videos (broadcast format). We labeled by ourselves the different areas of interest in the images (ice, boards, crowd, lines, circles, etc). We achieved interesting results where are able to recognizes pretty well components such as ice, crowd, board and lines. We are still working on the project to get improvements in recognizing more challenging components such as circles and dots. With this project, we concluded that CNN are powerfull tools to work with when learning things out of images. With more images and more work on the architecture of our models, we think we can achieve promising results and eventually used the representation learned to improve the tasks of projecting hockey events in 2-dimensionnal plans.
